    description: `Voted BEST HIPCAMP Glamping in the United States!! Come Glamping & experience our Rual Retreat here at Twisselman Ranch.

    -  Come glamp next to our pond under breathtaking stars located in beautiful Carrisa Plains, California. We are located about 1 hour east of Paso Robles California a short drive off highway 58 and about 1.5 hours west of Bakersfield.

   -  Cozy up in a comfy private canvas wall tent. The tent is fully furnished with a queen bed, side tables, chairs and/or coffee table. The tent also has a screen door and three screen windows to let the fresh breeze cool you off during the day. The tent is set on a raised deck to keep you and your belongings out of the dirt. Outside there is a picnic table or table & several chairs.

   ***Due to COVID guests will need to bring their own bedding/sleeping bag and pillows & towels, no soft furnishings will be provided other than a fitted sheet. This is for your safety & ours ;) ***

   - Tents can comfortably accommodate 2 adults & 3 small children, or 3 adults (twin & kid cots available upon request). If your group is any larger than that we recommend booking multiple glamping tents, or add a campsite ($60) to bring your own tent for the additional guests. Remember for all additional guests you'll need to bring bedding, pillows / cots etc.

   - Dogs are welcome, however, we charge  a $20 pet fee (per pet) due upon arrival.  (We accept cash or venmo)  All dogs must be kept on a leash at all times & never left unattended. There is livestock on the ranch as well as other guests and we want everyone to feel safe.  If your dog is prone to biting please do not bring it!

   -  Carrisa Plains is known for its beautiful display of wild flowers in the spring time, incredible sunny days, and spectacular wildlife viewing. The ranch is also located a short 29 min drive from the Carrizo Plain National Monument and Las Padres National Forest.

    -  Tule elk, prog horn antelope, and valley quail are just some of the animals you may encounter on our ranch. The pond is full of fish (bass, blue gill & sun perch) so don’t forget your fishing poles (catch & release).

   - At our pond camp we have several large shades along with many picnic tables, benches, and chairs scattered around the site.

   - We  have beautiful 2 stall hot water showers, and three stall restroom including handicap stall. **Cleaned & Sanitized DAILY

   -  Our communal kitchen has : a large gas bbq grill, 3 smaller gas grills as well as gas burners & sink. **Cleaned & Sanitized DAILY. There are several counter high prepping tables around the kitchen (please clean up your cooking essentials & food after each meal as everyone shares this space).

   - Seasonal Wood Burning Fires - Start your stay off right by purchasing a firewood bundle 8-10 pieces of wood perfect for bbq and/or evening campfires.

   In summer months we are an ember free site due to high wildfire risks, starting May 1st 2021 - Your $15 per night (additional nights can be payed for upon arrival) rents a propane fire pit, great for roasting s’mores & the ambience of camping. Please do not cook any meals on them. All cooking is to be done in the communal kitchen area.

   -  The summer days can get pretty toasty and the winter nights can get very chilly so check the weather before your stay and plan accordingly. Don’t forget your swim suits as we have soaking troughs for you to cool off in.

   -  Also please note we are located an hour from the nearest town, no stores or gas stations. Please come fully equipped with your own utensils, cooking essentials, food and beverages. We sell ICE!! $5 per 5lb bag.
