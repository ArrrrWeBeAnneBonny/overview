# FEC AnneBonny - HipCamp: Overview Service

> During our Front End Capstone (FEC), we were challenged to replicate a currently running business's item page. Replicating the information, look and event handling of the site. Our team, Anne Bonny, chose to do hipcamp (https://www.hipcamp.com/en-US/california/twisselman-ranch/twisselman-s-glamping-by-the-pond). My Service is the Overview service.
